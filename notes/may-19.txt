Gate synthesis is the process by which any single-qubit quantum gate can be implemented to any desired precision by finding an efficient sequence of gates drawn from a discrete set of well-calibarated and error corrected gates

logical layout generator and optimizer

1. Assign qubit variables to logical qubits similar to how variables are assigned to registers

logical qubits: Suitable for high level programming
Physical qubits: Noisy
Hardware qubits: Constrained to a specific quantum device chip


Towards topological quantum computer
anyons quantum evolutions are described by topology, they are absracted from geometric details
This makes them more resilient to perturbations and other such things
Topology: The study of the global properties of manifolds that are sensitive to local smooth deformations.

Both a donut and a cofee cup are described by genus one manifolds: there is a single hole in both

Taking a bite from the donut and chipping away at the cup will change the object locally


Universal gate sets
CNOT and single qubit gates
